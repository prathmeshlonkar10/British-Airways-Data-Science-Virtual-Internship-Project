## Highlight
A project with an opportunity to step into the shoes of a British Airways Data Scientist and complete tasks that replicate everyday work accomplished by the British Airways Data Science team. 
The project consists of 2 tasks that involve analyzing the scraped customer review data and building predictive models to predict customer buying behavior.


## Task 1: Web scraping to gain company insights
Scrape and analyze customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways
- Apply web scraping on unstructured third-party customer review data from https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways
- Analyze the scraped customer reviews using **Sentimental Analysis** (utilized NLTK library in Python) to classify positive, neutral, and negative reviews
- Present your insights and analysis using PowerPoint


## Task 2: Predicting customer buying behavior
Build a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behavior
- Prepare the data by performing EDA and feature engineering techniques
- Create a classification model to predict customer buying behavior
- Prepare a PowerPoint representation to highlight obtained insights and analysis
